The used terminology of the synthesized video file names is the following:

[scene name]_[method name].mp4

or 

[scene name]_[method name]_ss2.mp4

where for the 360-degree synthetic scenes there can be a subsampling factor of 2 regarding the number of images used for the method's training. In that case, at the end of the file name there is an additional "_ss2" term. 

For example, when referring to the synthesized video of the lego synthetic scene with DVGO method and a subsampling factor of 2, the file name is: lego_dvgo_ss2.mp4. Otherwise, when referring to the synthesized video of the lego synthetic scene with DVGO method and no subsampling, the file name is: lego_dvgo.mp4.
