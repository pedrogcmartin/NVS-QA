# NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation
## NVS-QA Database

Authors: Pedro Martin, António Rodrigues, João Ascenso, Maria Paula Queluz 

The NVS-QA database contains: 

+ Synthesized videos by 7 different NVS methods used with 16 different visual scenes (in the "Synthesized Videos" folder);
+ Reference videos of the corresponding visual scenes (in the "Reference Videos" folder);
+ Results of a subjective study comparing the qualities of the reference and synthesized videos by a group of 22 participants (in the "DMOS.xlsx" file);
+ Quality prediction results of a selection of 19 objective quality metrics on the reference and synthesized material (in the "metrics.xlsx" file);
+ Training dataset used for the NVS methods training (in the "Front-facing Dataset" folder) with eight, real and synthetic, front-facing (FF) camera acquisition visual scenes;
+ Camera paths with the pose estimation of the reference videos enabling the creation of synthesized videos with the same camera path (in the "Camera Paths" folder).
