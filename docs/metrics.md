# Objective Quality Metrics Information

The objective quality metrics selection was based on several criteria, notably: i) metrics that are typically applied in the NVS literature, namely PSNR-Y, PSNR-YUV, SSIM [5], MS-SSIM [6], LPIPS [7], and FovVideoVDP [8], since it is important to know whether they are in fact suitable for assessing the quality of NVS content; ii) metrics that have shown good performance in several image and video applications, such as PSNR-HVS [40], IW-SSIM [41], VIF and VIFp [42], FSIM [43], VSI [44], MAD [45], GMSD [46], and NLPD [47]; iii) learning-based metrics (besides LPIPS), namely ST-LPIPS [48], DISTS [49], and VMAF [50]; iv) MSE, since every selected NVS method includes it in the loss function. All metrics are full-reference.

Most of the selected metrics were designed for the quality assessment of still images (IQA metrics), with FovVideoVDP and VMAF being the exceptions as they were specifically tailored for video (VQA metrics). In this paper, the latter were directly applied to the reference and synthesized videos, whereas the former were applied to individual frames of both videos, followed by the averaging of the frame-based quality scores to obtain a global video score. In terms of the metrics implementation, while for DISTS, FovVideoVDP, IW-SSIM, LPIPS, PSNR-HVS, and VMAF the code was provided by the authors in their respective publications were used for the remaining metrics. The table above presents a comprehensive overview of the selected metrics, including their succinct descriptions, reference to the source code, and the used color space. As suggested in [51], [52], a disparity compensation should be performed between synthesized and reference images before applying conventional quality metrics (such as SSIM). In fact, even though the MRE is around 0.86 and 1.04 pixels for 360º real and FF real scenes, respectively, the NeRF pipeline may lead to an amplification effect of the pose errors negative impact on the synthesized view. Thus, the object shifts from the ground-truth to the synthesized image can be significantly higher than the corresponding MRE. Disparity compensation is performed with block-matching algorithm with a macroblock size of 32×32 pixels and search parameter of 12 pixels (except for the NeRF++ synthesized sequences of the antique and flowers scenes, where a value of 50 pixels was selected as disparities of more than 12 pixels were present).
